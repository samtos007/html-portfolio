<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a Telecommunication engineer who has a passion for software development and computer networking. I am a Cisco Certified Network Associate and 
  a good user of Power BI for data analysis. I have a good experience working on AC and DC voltage equipment. I interface with customers to learn of 
their challenges with the sole aim of solving it or proffering a better solution. I am a good manager of resources both human and material.</p>

<p>My passion for software development was ignited while I was an undergraduate at Lagos State University, Epe, Lagos State, Nigeria. I like to write codes and see them work 
  for the purpose(s) I wrote them. Also, I had the opportunity of being an intern in the IT department at a reputable company thereby falling in love with networking 
  which later spurred me to getting certified in Cisco technologies immediately after the internship program.
